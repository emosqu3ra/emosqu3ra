- 👋 Hi, I’m Estephanie
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a front end web developer, than full stack, and eventually a software engineer 
- 🌱 I’m currently in a bootcamp where I am learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Command Line, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap, DOM Manipulation, Object-Oriented Programming, Bash Scripting, Agile, Scrum, etc. I am cross referencing knowledge from Leon's #100Devs program as well. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can build my portfolio as a front end web developer.
- 📫 You can reach me at estephanie.lee@gmail.com
